# Network Analysis for Social Science

Network analysis has evolved beyond its traditional use in studying infrastructure systems, becoming a crucial tool in the examination of social systems. This approach is particularly valuable in understanding the interconnectivity and dependencies among different entities within a social network, providing a more comprehensive view of how social systems function and evolve over time.

A specific application of network analysis in the social sciences is social network analysis (SNA), which maps power and influence among stakeholders in governance systems. This technique reveals the underlying structure of relationships, highlighting influential actors and their connections within a network. Another application, discourse network analysis (DNA), focuses on the analysis of regulatory frameworks, identifying which regulations play the most strategic roles in managing complex issues, such as flood management in a region.
