# Jakarta Flood Risk Management

## Background

Jakarta, the bustling capital of Indonesia, faces significant flood risks due to a combination of geographical, climatic, and anthropogenic factors. Situated on a low-lying plain with 13 rivers flowing through the city, Jakarta is highly susceptible to flooding, particularly during the monsoon season when heavy rains and high tides converge.
