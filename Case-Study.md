# Ciliwung River Flood Risk Management

## Background

The Ciliwung River, which flows through Jakarta and its surrounding areas, poses a significant flood risk to the region due to its susceptibility to overflow during heavy rains. Rapid urbanization along the riverbanks has led to the loss of natural floodplains, reducing the river's capacity to manage excess water. Inadequate and poorly maintained drainage infrastructure further exacerbates the flooding problem, causing frequent and severe inundations in both residential and commercial areas. The river's catchment area also faces issues of deforestation and land-use changes, contributing to increased runoff and sedimentation that clog waterways. 

## Research Question:
